- ### Preamble

We are students of the Technische Berufsschule Zürich (TBZ) and this is a
project for the Module 431, an introductory Module to IT. This is a graded 
project that should teach us students important skills such as:

- Planning
- Kreativity
- Team work and coordination
- Time management
- Dokumentation for a project

As our group consists of students with previous IT experience we have decided
to make a simple game in the programming language Python. The general direction
of the game is to be an arcade game that is simple yet fun. We hope that we can
achieve our creative vision and challenge ourselves to learn new things.
